# Beat-Generation-using-Genetic-Algorithm
Simple beats are generated with options to change the speed, pauses, key, number of bars, scale etc. using signal wave processing and the PYO python library
The main concept is the use of signal wave processig which generates the beats/sounds. The genetic algorithm helps find the best output after each iteration which can be rated. The code also includes number of bar, pause introsuction, population size and other parameters to ensure each beat developed is unique in its own aspect. The genetic alogorithm has to be implemented. I have attached a requirements file which need to be installed before running the program. Happy Learning! :)
